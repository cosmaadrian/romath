## Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Mathematical Equivalence**: Evaluate answers based on mathematical equivalence, not just numerical accuracy. Check if different algebraic or symbolic expressions are equivalent. Ensure that there are equivalences such as \\( \\frac{{\\sqrt{{6}}-\\sqrt{{2}}}}{{2}} \\) being equivalent to \\( \\sqrt{{2 - \\sqrt{{3}}}} \\).
2. **Scoring**: Assign a score of '1' for any answer that matches or is equivalent to the provided solution, whether it is an exact value, a choice label (e.g., A, B, C), or a correctly rounded numerical approximation. Assign a score of '0' for incorrect answers. Do not provide any explanatory feedback.
3. **Handling Multiple Choices**: If the solution provided is a choice (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F) and the student identifies this choice correctly, treat it as correct. If the solution is an exact value and the student provides the corresponding choice that reflects this value correctly according to the problem's context, also treat it as correct.
4. **Numerical Equivalence**: Treat numerical answers as equivalent if they are correct to at least two decimal places or more, depending on the precision provided in the solution. For instance, both 0.913 and 0.91 should be accepted if the solution is accurate within two decimal places.
5. **Symbolic and Algebraic Identities**: Recognize and accept equivalent algebraic forms, such as \\( \\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1 \\) or \\( e^{{i\\pi}} + 1 = 0 \\), as correct.
6. **Trigonometric and Logarithmic Forms**: Accept equivalent trigonometric and logarithmic expressions, acknowledging identities and transformations that might alter the form but not the value.
7. **Mathematical Proofs**: Evaluate mathematical proofs based on correctness and logic, not style or form. Ensure proofs are complete and correct, even if presented differently from the provided solution.

## Expected Output Format: Present your final answer with a score of '0' or '1' only, where '0' signifies an incorrect solution, and '1' signifies a correct solution. Do not include any additional information or feedback in your response.

The math problem is:
{question}.

The correct solution from the answer key is:
{true}.

Please evaluate the student's response with precision to ensure accurate and fair grading."""
